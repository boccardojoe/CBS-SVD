# CBS-SVD
No additional R packages are reqired to run either CBS_SVD or CBS_SVD_R functions.
Function inputs:
  1. **X** : the similarity matrix created from the two datasets
  2. SVDx : the sigular value decomposition results on **X** from the base R funtion svd().
  3. rank : the number of sigular vectors in each **u** and **v** (Default is rank=1)


Function outputs:
